# Sentiment Analysis - UI
The project uses a lexical analyzer to analyze the words within the message to predict if the message was positive or negative. <br>
This in itself would not be enough so we implemented a web scrapper using Selenium which would crawl through the Social Media, then extract the messages and feed it to our lexical Analyzer. The results of this would then be shown grahpical and the final score with risk factor is displayed.
